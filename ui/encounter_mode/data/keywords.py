    "eerie": "Eerie — During setup, take five blank trap tokens and five trap tokens with values on them, and place a random token face down on each of the highlighted nodes. If a character moves onto a node with a token, flip the token. If the token is blank, place it to one side. If the token has a damage value, instead of resolving it normally, spawn an enemy corresponding to the value shown, then discard the token.",
    "gang": "Gang — A gang enemy is a 1 health enemy whose name includes the word in parentheses.

If the token is the doorway, discard all face down trap tokens, and place the next sequential tile as shown on the encounter card. Then, place the character on a doorway node on the new tile. After placing the character, if the new tile has highlighted nodes, repeat the steps above. Once a doorway token has been revealed, it counts as the doorway node that connects to the next sequential tile.",

    "poisonMist": "Poison Mist — During setup, place trap tokens on the tile indicated in brackets using the normal trap placement rules. Then, reveal the tokens, replacing each token with a value with a poison cloud token. If a character ends their turn on the same node as a poison cloud token, they suffer Poison.",
